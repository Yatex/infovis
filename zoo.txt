Our society is producing digital information at an astonishing rate.
The goal of visualization is to aid our understanding of data by leveraging the human visual system’s highly-tuned ability to
 see patterns, spot trends, and identify outliers.
Parallel coordinates (||-coord) take a different approach to visualizing multivariate data. Instead of graphing every pair of
 variables in two dimensions, we repeatedly plot the data on parallel axes and then connect the corresponding points with lines. Each poly-line represents a single row in the database and line crossings between dimensions often indicate inverse correlation. Re-ordering dimensions can aid pattern-finding, as can interactive querying to filter along one more dimensions. Another advantage of parallel coordinates is that they are relatively compact and so many variables can be shown simultaneously.
Data is often collected and aggregated by geographical areas such as states. A standard approach to communicating this data is
 to use a color encoding of the geographic area, resulting in a choropleth map.
An alternative to choropleth maps is the graduated symbol map, which instead places symbols over an underlying map. This
 approach avoids confounding geographic area with data values and allows for more dimensions to be visualized
An alternative visualization scheme is the dendrogram (or “cluster”) algorithm, which places leaf nodes of the tree at the
 same level.
By packing circles instead of subdividing rectangles, we can produce a different sort of enclosure diagram that has an almost
 organic appearance. While it does not use space as efficiently as a treemap, the “wasted space” of circle-packing layouts
  effectively reveals the hierarchy. At the same time, node sizes can be rapidly compared using area judgments.
A common and intuitive approach to network layout is to model the graph as a physical system: nodes are charged particles
 that repel each other, while links are dampened springs that pull related nodes together.

Depict aggregate patterns and often support drill-down
The “sunburst” layout is equivalent to the “icicle” layout,
In addition, interactivity allows the user to direct the layout and jiggle nodes to disambiguate links.
